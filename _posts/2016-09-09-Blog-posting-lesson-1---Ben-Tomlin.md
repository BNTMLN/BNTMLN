    <td>I asked around the class for help on how to change my background and I also asked Mr Tansley for help. Asking mr Tansley for help actually helped the most.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mr Tansley had to help the whole class as well as me which limited my time with him, which also made me struggle with adding my blogs to my page. I also ticked the wrong thing when publishing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try and attempt to fix my problems before putting my hand up, ask friends before Mr Tansley. This will improve my learning because I can get more things done when I would've been just waiting for a teacher to come to me.</td>
