**Blog 1**

**What I did: **

Today, I tried to fix my old blog, because it broke last term and I have not been able to fix it since. I also changed my background on my website 3 times to find the perfect picture with high resolution and size. I also removed the footer because it was annoying. I started to make a quiz on [Repl.it ](https://repl.it/)and I began to make the basics to my quiz.

**What I learned**

Repl variables and how to use them eg: IF, ELIF, ELSE 

How to change a background on my website. 

And how to erase the footer.

**What went wrong**

My background took 10 - 15 mins to change every time.

The footer still has a small line going across the screen 

The background isn't fixed

My quiz doesn't load/ I havenâ€™t finished it
